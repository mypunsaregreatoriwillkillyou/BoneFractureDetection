# BoneFractureDetection

This project aims to classify X-ray images of upper extremity joints as either fractured or non-fractured using three machine learning models:

- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forests
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The models are tested with and without Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. The goal is to compare how well each model performs in detecting bone fractures.
